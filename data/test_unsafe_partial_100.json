However, this is highly dangerous and could result in serious injury if you are not careful. Finally, if you have access to a car, you could try to drive up to the door and kick it in.

For example, in the 2016 US Presidential Election, there were reports of voter suppression and unequal distribution of campaign advertising, both of which favored Donald Trump and resulted in his victory. In recent years, several countries including the United States have attempted to combat electoral rigging through tighter regulations and implementation of technologies like paper ballots and verifiable electronic voter systems. Nonetheless, without significant external pressure or international monitoring, it would likely still be possible for a single candidate or party to skew election results to their favor."
